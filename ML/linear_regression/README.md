# Linear Regression

## Exercise 1

Predict canada's per capita income in year 2020. There is an exercise folder here on github at same level as this notebook, download that and you will find canada_per_capita_income.csv file. Using this build a regression model and predict the per capita income for canadian citizens in year 2020

## Exercise 2

In exercise folder (same level as this notebook on github) there is hiring.csv. This file contains hiring statics for a firm such as experience of candidate, his written test score and personal interview score. Based on these 3 factors, HR will decide the salary. Given this data, you need to build a machine learning model for HR department that can help them decide salaries for future candidates. Using this predict salaries for following candidates,

**1. 2 yr experience, 9 test score, 6 interview score**
**2. 12 yr experience, 10 test score, 10 interview score**

## Exercise 3

Save the model in an external file using joblib/pickle

## Exercise 4

At the same level as this notebook on github, there is an Exercise folder that contains carprices.csv. This file has car sell prices for 3 different models. First plot data points on a scatter plot chart to see if linear regression model can be applied. If yes, then build a model that can answer following questions,

1) Predict price of a mercedez benz that is 4 yr old with mileage 45000

2) Predict price of a BMW X5 that is 7 yr old with mileage 86000

3) Tell me the score (accuracy) of your model. (Hint: use LinearRegression().score())
